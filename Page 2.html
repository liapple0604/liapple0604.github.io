<h2>梦散经年，玉颜别、愁伤南浦。 更雨撒、青斑丝缕，如人啼舞。 千里天涯徒相顾，三年往昔空踌躇。 看秋风一片、绪难酬，空悲语。</h2>
<p>After years of scattered dreams, I bid farewell to my jade face and felt sorrow for Nanpu.
Even more rain falls, with green spots and threads, like people singing and dancing.
Thousands of miles away, wandering aimlessly for three years.
Watching the autumn breeze, emotions are difficult to repay, empty and sorrowful words.经过多年的漂泊梦想，我告别了玉脸，为南浦感到悲伤。
更多的雨落下，带着绿色的斑点和线，就像人们唱歌跳舞一样。
千里之外，漫无目的地游荡了三年。
望着秋风，情感难以回报，言语空洞而悲伤。</p>
